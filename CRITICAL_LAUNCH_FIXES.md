# Critical App Store Launch Fixes

## App Store Requirements
1. **Create Privacy Policy** for App Store submission
2. **Generate App Store screenshots** for all device sizes  
3. **Create complete App Icon set** (all iOS sizes, not just 1024x1024)
4. **Write App Store metadata** (description, keywords, categories, age rating)
5. **Add proper Bundle Identifier and version numbers** to Info.plist
6. **Remove NSAllowsArbitraryLoads security setting** from Info.plist
7. **Create Support/Contact URL** for App Store listing

## UI/UX Critical Fixes
8. **Design and implement onboarding flow** for new users
   - Welcome screen explaining what SkateFit is (skateboarding-specific fitness)
   - Difficulty level explanation screen (beginner/intermediate/advanced with examples)
   - Equipment overview (resistance bands, dumbbells, etc.)
   - How the app works (workout structure: warm-up → main → cool-down)
   - Video player controls tutorial (swipe between exercises, tap to see details)
   - Optional: fitness level assessment to recommend starting difficulty
   - Skip option for returning users
   - Store onboarding completion in UserDefaults to only show once
9. **Improve splash screen design** while keeping current skating logo

These 9 items are the minimum needed for App Store approval and good first-time user experience.
