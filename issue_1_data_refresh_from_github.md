# Issue 1: Data Refresh from GitHub

## Problem Statement
The SkateFit iOS app is not properly refreshing workout data from the GitHub repository. Despite GitHub containing 5 workouts, the app consistently shows only 4 workouts, even after implementing pull-to-refresh and cache clearing mechanisms.

## Current Behavior
1. GitHub repo has 5 workouts (confirmed via curl)
2. App shows 4 workouts on startup
3. Pull-to-refresh triggers but still shows 4 workouts
4. Cache clearing (long press on title) doesn't resolve the issue
5. App restart doesn't help

## Root Cause Analysis

### GitHub Side ‚úÖ WORKING
- Local file: `workouts.json` contains 5 workouts
- Git commits: Successfully pushed to GitHub
- API access: `curl` commands return 5 workouts correctly
- Cache busting: URLs with timestamps work correctly

### iOS App Side ‚ùå BROKEN
**Problem identified in `GitHubContentService.downloadAndCacheWorkouts()`**

The app logs show:
```
Downloading workouts from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/banddude/skate-fit-files/main/workouts.json?cache=1756069514
Downloaded and cached 4 workouts
```

**Issue**: The download is only returning 4 workouts despite GitHub having 5.

## Technical Details

### App Flow
1. `refreshContent()` calls `clearCache()` ‚úÖ
2. `loadWorkouts()` finds no cache, calls `downloadAndCacheWorkouts()` ‚úÖ  
3. `downloadAndCacheWorkouts()` gets URL with cache-busting timestamp ‚úÖ
4. **URLSession downloads data but gets wrong count** ‚ùå

### Debugging Steps Taken
1. ‚úÖ Confirmed GitHub has 5 workouts
2. ‚úÖ Confirmed curl with same cache-busting URLs works
3. ‚úÖ Added debug logging to see actual download response
4. ‚úÖ Verified cache clearing works
5. ‚úÖ Confirmed pull-to-refresh calls correct methods

### Next Steps
1. **Debug the URLSession response** - Check actual downloaded data content
2. **Check JSON parsing** - Verify all 5 workouts are in downloaded data
3. **Timing issue investigation** - Check if GitHub CDN needs more time
4. **Alternative approach** - Consider using GitHub API instead of raw URLs

## Code Locations
- **GitHubContentService.swift**: `downloadAndCacheWorkouts()` method
- **ContentManager.swift**: `refreshContent()` method
- **WorkoutsView.swift**: Pull-to-refresh implementation

## Expected vs Actual
- **Expected**: App shows 5 workouts after refresh
- **Actual**: App consistently shows 4 workouts

## Status
üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Core functionality broken, affecting user experience

## Added Debug Code
Enhanced `downloadAndCacheWorkouts()` with:
- Data size logging
- Response content preview
- Workout count verification
- Workout names debugging

**Next action**: Test with debug logs to see exact download content.
